I have been writing software since the late 90s and fell in love with iOS development after the iPhone launch in 2007. Since then, Iâ€™ve been writing iOS apps most of the time, but I also enjoy writing Javascript and putting things online.

During the day, I lead an iOS team at Automattic and go out for mid-day Mountain Bike rides, and at night, I take on cool personal projects and experiments.

Iâ€™m always available at [Twitter](https://twitter.com/afterxleep), and frequently pushing bits to one of my [Github repos](https://github.com/afterxleep).

For more serious stuff, you can always find me on [LinkedIn](http://linkedin.com/in/danielbernalm) or <a href="&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#58;&#121;&#111;&#64;&#100;&#97;&#110;&#105;&#101;&#108;&#98;&#101;&#114;&#110;&#97;&#108;&#46;&#99;&#111;">&#69;&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;</a>
