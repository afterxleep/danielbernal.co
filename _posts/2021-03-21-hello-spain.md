Back in November 2020, and after a few long conversations, we decided to sell everything we owned and move to Spain. Between preparations, paperwork, and a long garage sale we finally got here last week, with just a few suitcases and both our pets, Tesla and Oli.<!--more-->

We just completed our first week in Madrid and will be out of the mandatory 10-day quarantine in a couple of days when we will continue with the plan of moving to Valencia, given COVID restrictions allow.

Although I have a few tech friends up here, Iâ€™d love to connect with the iOS development community around and see what you folks are up to!

See you around!
