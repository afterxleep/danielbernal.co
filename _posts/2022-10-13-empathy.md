As I was walking around downtown the other day, this grafitti caught my eye.<!--more-->

![La empatia salva](/assets/empathy-saves.jpeg)

Roughly translated, it says:

>**Empathy saves…**<br><br>
Empathy saves lives, situations, whales, oceans, relationships, wishes, thoughts, homes, families, friends, ideas, bees, cyclists, pedestrians, poems, kisses, conversations, hugs, breakfasts, bakeries, companies, songs, books, recipes, clients, plants, jungles. It saves you and everything along your way, and that’s a lot. 

I couldn’t have said it better myself. – We need more empathy everywhere.
