There is nothing better than giving yourself time not to do anything so that you can do a bunch of things without obligation.

In the past week, I have read two books, updated two apps, started with a new idea, learned about SwiftUI, wrote two articles, picked up my mountain bike again, reconnected with my family and friends, rewrote my CV, slept for 16 hours straight and ate and sleep whenever I felt like it.<!--more-->  

I've done a lot of things, but for some reason, don't feel tired, stressed, or overwhelmed at all.  I guess sometimes we forget that a good vacation does not always mean Netflix, the beach, or uploading leisure photos to Instagram.  

Go ahead, find yourself some guilt-free time, and commit to skipping the compromises, obligations, and urgency of life.  Just do whatever comes to mind.  I promise you will not regret it.
