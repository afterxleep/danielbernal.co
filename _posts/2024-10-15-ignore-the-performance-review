The next promotion, the next chance to earn more, gain influence, or power. Ambition is treated as the ultimate measure of worth at work. If you don’t have it, someone else will snatch your job away from you.

We’ve been fed this bullshit for years. Being comfortable at work is confused with laziness. We stigmatize those who <!--more-->don’t buy into the corporate ladder, ignoring that they’re often the ones who understand what’s truly enough.

I respect people who push themselves to learn and grow because they want to—not because a promotion demands it. Unlike ambition, this kind of growth is about becoming a better person. Those are the ones I want to work with. They lift everyone around them. It’s contagious.

If climbing the corporate ladder is your thing, that’s fine. Just don’t confuse it with growth. Ambition and growth aren’t the same thing.

At some point in their careers, some people might just want to do their job and be done for the day. That’s perfectly fine. It’s okay to ignore the performance review, the bigger paycheck, and the promotion. It’s okay to be comfortable at work and choose yourself over others' career expectations.

Figure out what it takes to become a better person, not just a better employee. That’s the only growth that matters in the long run.
