Learn to accept risks and live by them. Removing every possible risk results in bland, uninspired work that aims to offend no one.

De-risking everything makes you ship average shit. The fear of failure and making mistakes leads to a culture where safety and mediocrity become the norm. Youâ€™re left with something so sanitized that it fails to compete, yet you think it is great.

You should be embracing risks, not removing them.
