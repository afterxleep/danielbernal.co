If you find something broken, ask 'why' instead of 'who'. Then, fix it and move on.

'Who' involves blame and diverts energy from progress. Instead of indulging in ego, channel your efforts into the repairs. 

Taking responsibility in silence is a testament to leadership and sets a precedent for others.

Progress doesn't need a spotlight; it just needs to happen. 

Call dibs.
