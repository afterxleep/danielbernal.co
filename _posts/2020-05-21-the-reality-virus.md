It's a lot of fun to take a peek at improvised home offices set up by reporters, actors, politicians, and people on TV.  It adds some sort of warmth and coziness to the news, even if reality is crude and difficult.

On video calls, CEOs are no longer shaving every day, sales VPs join meetings on sweatshirts <!--more-->with kids jumping all over the place, dogs and cats take over client webcams, and families engage in serious conversations in the background of job interviews.

It's amazing how, without the fanciness and makeup, everyone looks and sounds more real, honest, and down to earth, and people are suddenly more open and willing to share, yet still, the world keeps moving forward as it should.

While COVID will eventually subside, I hope this new reality virus stays with us for a long time.
