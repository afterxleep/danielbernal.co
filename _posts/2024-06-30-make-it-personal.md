I take everything personally, and don’t trust anyone who says they don’t. It’s either a lie or a sign they don’t care enough.  Emotional detachment is often seen as a strength, but it’s really an excuse for mediocrity.

Taking things personally goes beyond emotional involvement. It’s a testament to commitment and authenticity. It shows you’re human and invested enough to understand the impact of your actions.

If you really care about to make a differece, make it personal.
