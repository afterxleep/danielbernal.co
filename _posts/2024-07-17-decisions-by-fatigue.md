“Prove me wrong, and I’ll change my mind” is a shitty approach.

Teamwork isn’t about winning arguments or proving points. It’s about collaboration, trust, and mutual respect. When you set up a discussion with the premise of proving someone wrong (you included), you’re creating a hostile environment. It’s combative, not cooperative. It wears people down and discourages participation.<!--more-->

Instead of challenging others to prove you wrong, listen. Try to understand the experiences that shape their views. People don’t always have tangible proof; they speak from the voice of experience, and that’s ten times more valuable than any isolated example.

Demanding proof drains other people’s energy, and decisions made under such pressure are often poor and driven by fatigue, not insight.
