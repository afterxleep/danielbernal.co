I moved this blog out of [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/). Don't get me wrong, I still work at [Automattic](https://automattic.com), but WordPress has too many moving parts for my needs.

Since I don't need fancy templates, plugins<!--more-->, databases, comments, stats, a store, and much less dealing with security updates, backups, and hosting providers, I wanted to try a static solution.

It made a lot of sense. I could host it on Github pages and forget about security or hosting providers, and my posts would live in beautiful, clean markdown files.

Setting up [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), importing a few posts, migrating my [WordPress template](https://github.com/afterxleep/danielbernal_co) to HTML, and connecting the domain took me a couple of hours. Pretty cheap for a super-fast, highly reliable, pure HTML blog, right?

Well, maybe, but I also spent two hours trying to post the above paragraphs from an iPad last night. ðŸ¤”

It went like this:

* Purchase and install a good text editor with Files App support ([Textastic](https://www.textasticapp.com/)).
* Purchase and install a git client with Files App support ([Working Copy](https://workingcopy.app/)).
* Create a file by hand with a particular name.
* Copy and paste some config options.
* Write the post.
* Add a picture to a folder.
* Link the image by hand using markdown.
* Create a git commit and push it to the repository.
* Notice the attached photo was broken.
* Remove the image.
* Create another commit and push it to the repo again.

Pretty rough, huh? 

I thought about switching to [HEY World](https://world.hey.com/) for a while, and although I don't really want to loose the flexibility of having my own thing, I don't want to be slaved by it, so see you in [Hey World](https://world.hey.com/danielbernal)
