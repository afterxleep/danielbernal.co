I moved this out of [WordPress](https://wordpress.org).  It has too many moving parts for my needs and the amount of content I put online. 

Since I don't need fancy templates, plugins, databases, comments, stats, a store, and much less dealing with security updates, backups, and hosting providers, I wanted to try a static solution.<!-- more -->

It made a lot of sense. I could host it on Github pages and forget about security or hosting providers, and my posts would live in beautiful, clean markdown files.

It took me a couple of hours to set up [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), import a few posts, migrate my WordPress template, and connect the domain. Pretty cheap for a super-fast, highly reliable, pure HTML blog, right?

Err... no. I spent another two hours trying to post the above paragraphs to my new blog this morning. 

It went like this:

- Purchase and install a good text editor with Files App support ([Textastic](https://www.textasticapp.com)).
- Purchase and install a git client with Files App support ([Working Copy](https://workingcopy.app)).
- Create a file by hand with a particular name.
- Copy and paste some config options.
- Write the post.
- Add a picture to a folder.
- Link the image by hand using markdown.
- Create a git commit and push it to the repository.
- Notice the attached photo was broken.
- Remove the image.
- Create another and push it to the repo again.

Fuck that. I'm out.

I thought about switching to [HEY World](https://world.hey.com) for a while, but I didn't want to lose my tools. Still, these tools are not making me a better writer. They're just getting in the way.
