You weren’t hired to be a menu; you were hired to make things happen. Presenting multiple solutions to every problem doesn’t move things forward; it just creates noise and unnecessary debate.

If you’re at a restaurant, options are great. But when you know the best approach, offering bogus choices is just plain stupid. You know what to do, so stop waffling around.<!--more-->

Trust your judgment and do it. Results will speak for themselves. Your value lies in cutting through the noise, not adding to it.
