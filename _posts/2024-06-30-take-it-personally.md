I don’t trust anyone who says they don’t take things personally. It’s either a lie or a sign they don’t care enough.  Emotional detachment is often seen as a strength, but it’s another excuse for mediocrity.

Taking things personally goes beyond emotional involvement. It’s a testament to commitment and authenticity. It shows you’re human and invested enough to understand the impact of your actions.

Ultimately, those who take things personally are the ones who care enough to make a difference.
