I've found a reference to [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuYlGRnC7J8) in [Shawn Blanc's blog](https://shawnblanc.net/2022/09/plan-vs-strategy-and-why-a-plan-is-not-a-strategy/) the other day and also loved how it explains the difference between the two concepts.



It is fascinating to watch as a reminder, especially because planning is comfortable, and we tend to do too much of it.  <!--more-->

Planning makes us feel we're in control and think we are moving forward, but while we spend days sitting down in a room planning the next move, at least one competitor is figuring out how to win.

Strategy is also more than a list of goals.  It has to be backed by a theory that explains and consolidates "WHY" and "HOW" in a coherent way.
