 [I joined Automattic](https://danielbernal.co/2020/10/02/joining-automattic/)  in 2020 after more than five years in management roles at different consulting companies. Going back to coding full-time was a challenge on its own, but it was also the perfect opportunity to move back to product development and take on the exciting challenge of leading iOS Core at Tumblr.<!--more-->

This has been the best job Iâ€™ve had so far. A team spread across 8 time zones, millions of users, vast amounts of information to explore, asynchronous communication, and extreme levels of autonomy are not for everyone, but I felt at home from day one. In that sense, things are not very different from where Iâ€™m going.

Today is my last day at Automattic, as next month, Iâ€™ll be joining  [DuckDuckGoâ€™s](https://duckduckgo.com/)  Engineering team as a Senior Software Engineer (ðŸ’ª finally!), and I couldnâ€™t be more excited about it. Â 

See you on the Duck side!
