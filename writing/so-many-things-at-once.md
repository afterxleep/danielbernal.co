I don't remember the last time I wanted to do this many things at once.

Some idea hits at midnight and by 2am there's a working prototype. One side project becomes three. A chat turns into code before I can even finish my coffee.

There's no friction anymore. The days or weeks between idea and something real don't exist anymore. One prompt, some iteration, and suddenly it's clickable.

I used to filter ideas by effort and complexity. "That would take too long", "I'll have to learn XYZ first". Had valid reasons to let something die almost all the time. Now nothing takes too long, and I'm drowning in my own enthusiasm.

Terminal windows everywhere with things I forgot I started. Projects half-alive waiting for attention. Things I shipped last week I haven't touched since.

It's crazy, but It's also the most alive I've felt building things in years.

I don't know if this pace is sustainable or if I'm just riding a wave that will crash. But right now, I'd rather have too many things calling for attention than spend another decade filtering myself before I start.

Its a mess, but that's the the point.
